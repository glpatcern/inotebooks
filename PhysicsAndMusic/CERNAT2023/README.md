## The Physics of Music from Pythagoras to Microtones - CERN Academic Training 2023

Here you find some iPython notebooks used for the audio demonstrations proposed during the lectures held at CERN in May 2023.

The lectures and their recordings are available at:

The code has been executed with a local setup of JupyterLab, and requires the installation of some python custom modules to manipulate sounds. To validate your setup you can use the `Prerequisites.ipynb` notebook, whereas the other notebooks provide examples of beatings and chords. The `harmony.py` module must be located in the same folder and acts as backend of the `Musical intervals` notebook.
