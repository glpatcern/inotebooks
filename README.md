# inotebooks

This is a repo with useful Jupyter notebooks used e.g. for trainings at CERN and at University of Ferrara.

The [PhysicsAndMusic](https://gitihub.com/glpatcern/inotebooks/tree/master/PhysicsAndMusic) folder includes the code developed for the article _"Dyad's Consonance and Dissonance: combining the roughness and compactness approaches"_, published by the [EPJP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03456-2), as well as for subsequent articles and trainings.
