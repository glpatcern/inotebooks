Italian Teachers Programme - Experience
=======================================

Those notebooks have been used for the 2019 pilot edition of the ITP Experience programme at CERN, cf. https://indico.cern.ch/event/775936 for further details.

Many explanations are in Italian. All datasets have been taken from public sources.

You can browse the notebooks here in a static format, or go to:

for the jupyter viewer, where the 'Execute on Binder' button on the top-right makes them runnable.
